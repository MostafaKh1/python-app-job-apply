About the job
About Ideawise
At Ideawise, we build communities that empower people to live authentic and fulfilled lives. Our mission is to create impactful user experiences, and we’re seeking multiple Frontend Developers for the Acquisition, Rentention and Monetization Squads. Have a look at the description of one of these profiles, the Frontend Developer Acquisition Squad, below.
We need this Frontend Developer for the Acquisition Squad to tackle critical landing page, user registration, onboarding, and activation challenges. If left unfilled, we risk missing crucial opportunities to convert potential users—especially on mobile. Timely hiring ensures we can implement and test new acquisition strategies quickly, staying ahead in a competitive market.

Job Profile: 
The Acquisition Squad is responsible for driving new user signups, optimizing user funnels, and ensuring a high-performing landing experience for both POP and FET.
As we expand our marketing campaigns and user acquisition strategies, we need a seasoned Frontend Developer to create mobile-friendly landing pages, sign-up flows, and promotional components that convert efficiently.
Our success depends on delivering fast, responsive experiences that motivate potential users to join our platforms.
By rapidly iterating on A/B tests and data-driven improvements, this role will help us attract the right audience, improve registration, onboarding, and activation, which are the foundation for long-term user engagement.

Goals / OKRs Contribution:
Boost conversion rates across all acquisition funnels, particularly on mobile devices.
Implement and optimize landing pages and sign-up flows to support marketing campaigns and reduce bounce rates.
Crossfunctional collaboration with multi-disciplinary professionals (Data, Marketing, Product, Design) to ensure a cohesive brand and user experience.
Drive short-term success by releasing impactful UI/UX improvements and mid-term growth by continuously refining the acquisition journey.
Frontend Developers work on Ideawise products. This includes the ones facing users and the internal services. They work together with Product Owners, Designers, and Backend Developers to achieve common goals. They report to the Development Manager.

Tech Requirements:
Professional experience with React/Redux, or another modern JavaScript web framework ( VueJS, Angular, etc)
Experience using Git in a professional/workplace environment
A solid understanding of core web and browser concepts (eg. how the browser parses and constructs a web page)
A solid understanding of semantic HTML, CSS, and core JavaScript concepts.
Experience with performance and optimization problems and a demonstrated ability to both diagnose and prevent these problems
Experience working with Scrum
Hands on coding focusing on the eXtreme Programming practices
Extensive professional experience with Typescript
Strong knowledge of architecture and development patterns (e.g. Microservices, CQRS, Domain Driven Design, Event Sourcing etc.)
A passion for continuous learning and sharing knowledge with others
Experience with writing automated test
An appreciation for good development practices (Test-driven development, pair programming, continuous integration/deployment)

Nice to have:
Working knowledge of Node.js, the latest Webpack.
Working knowledge of PHP, Go, or other Backend programming language
Experience in the social network industry
Product-focused company experience
Experience working with a remote team
Experience working with a global or multicultural team
Experience contributing to open-source software

What type of person are we looking for?
Attitudes (not just skills) similar to a Tech Lead 
Go beyond “tickets.” We want someone who’s proactive—thinking about the best solutions rather than just executing tasks mindlessly.
Know the product you’re working on. Understand how features work and the data behind them. If you’re only here to “code and nothing more,” it might not be a good match. (P.S. If having a dating app on your phone could cause “relationship issues,” we’ll help you explain it!) 
Propose ideas. We don’t believe in “That’s the PM/PO’s job.” If you’ve seen a feature elsewhere that could fit, or you notice a way to improve something, let us know. The best ideas often come from unexpected places.
Help the team understand the tech landscape. You don’t need to give a masterclass on Expo or complex React Native concepts, but a bit of “evangelizing” is welcome—explain what we’ve built, how it works, and why things take the time they do.
Bring good vibes. You don’t have to share your personal life (unless you want to!), but engage with the team, be curious, and stay open to learning from their day-to-day. We save long faces for funerals. 

Education
We don’t care about the degree you have or which university you attended. What truly matters to us is what you know and, more importantly, how you apply it. That’s why your academic background isn’t as important as what you can demonstrate in our interviews, both technical and non-technical.

Why Join Us?
Impactful Work: Shape the future of our app monetization strategy.
Global Team: Collaborate with talented professionals from around the world.
Remote Flexibility: Work from anywhere with flexible hours.
Growth Opportunities: Access to training, mentorship, and career advancement.
